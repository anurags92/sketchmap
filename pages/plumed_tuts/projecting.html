   <h2>  Out-of-sample embedding </h2>
   
   <p>
      After the low-d embedding of the landmark points has been
      worked out, one can use it to define a map which allows to
      project additional points. In other terms, a set of sketch-map
      collective coordinates can be computed for any configuration
      of the system. This final step is delegated to the
      <span class="code">dimred</span> utility.

   <div class="body" id="tut-proj" style="display: block;">
      <p>
         We need first to prepare two files with the landmarks, one containing
         the high-dimensional coordinates (plus weights) and another containing the sketch-mapped
         ones, without headers or extra columns. Then we run
      </p>
      <div class="code" >
         dimproj -D 24 -d 2 -P highd-landmarks -p lowd-landmarks -pi 6.283185 -w 
         -grid 15.0,21,201 -fun-hd 6,12,12 -fun-ld 6,1,2 -cgmin 3 < highd-new > lowd-new
      </div>
      <p>
         Here most of the options correspond to those in the sketch-map step, 
         given the close analogy between the sketch-map stress function and the
         one which is used for the out-of-sample embedding. After having performed
         a grid search based on the parameters provided, a few conjugate gradient
         steps are performed (<span class="code">-cgmin</span>).

      The image below shows the embedding of the circa 50000 configurations of
      the trajectory, colored as usual based on just one of the backbone dihedral.
      Despite the fact that the landmarks are a very coarse sampling of the
      configuration space, the out-of-sample sketch-map embedding separates nicely
      between different structures, and shows a remarkably rich picture of the 
      many metastable states accessible to this simple model polypeptide.
