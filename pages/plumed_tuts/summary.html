   <h2> A sketch-map tutorial </h2>
   <div>
      This tutorials aims at being a "walk-through" to help you apply sketch map to your 
      high-dimensional data.  We will use as an example a quite challenging case, namely
      the mapping in two dimensions of a set of configurations of the model polypeptide dodeca-alanine
      which are represented  by the 24 backbone dihedral angles. <br/>
      Before you start, you should download and compile the <a href='index?page=code'>sketch-map tools</a>.
      You can then either experiment with the <a href='data/smap_tutorial_data.zip'>data file</a> for 
      dodeca-alanine, or prepare your own data set in a file formatted with one sample per line,
      e.g
      <div class="code" style="width: 500px">
        x<sub>1</sub>(1) x<sub>2</sub>(1) .... x<sub>D</sub>(1)<br/>
        x<sub>1</sub>(2) x<sub>2</sub>(2) .... x<sub>D</sub>(2)<br/>        
        ....

   <p>
      As with most of non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, sketch-map works
      by finding a set of low-dimensional points which reproduce the pair-wise similarity
      between the samples of the high-dimensional data set. Whereas other NLDR methods
      try to match some sort of distance between the points, sketch-map focuses on
      reproducing proximity, i.e. making sure that points that are "close" in high dimension
      will be "close" in low dimension, and those which are "far" in high dimension will
      be "far" in high dimension. Finding a viable definition of proximity requires
      some preliminary data analysis, which allows one to determine optiimal parameters
      for running sketch-map.

      The tutorial covers all the steps necessary to obtain a satisfactory low-dimensional
      embedding, including:
   </p>   
   <ul>
      <li> data analysis and selection of sketch-map parameters </li>
      <li> selection of landmark points </li>
      <li> the actual sketch-map optimization </li>
      <li> out-of-sample embedding of the remaining configurations </li>
   </ul>
