   <h2>  Gnuplot wisdom </h2>
   
   <p>
      The figures in this tutorial were produced using Mathematica. 
      However, very similar results can be obtained with a recent version
      of <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/" target="new">gnuplot</a>.<br/>
      Here, a few tips are listed which can be helpful to get the most out
      of gnuplot in order to obtain insightful and visually compelling
      representations of the low-dimensional embedding.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      A first suggestion is to use <span class="code">lt palette</span> to
      color the points according to the value of individual high-dimensional
      descriptors: this can help verifying that the proximity information 
      has been embedded properly - with the caveat that if uninteresting CVs
      had been included in the high-D set, there may be very little correlation
      between their values and the position in the embedding.
   </p>
   <div class="code">
      gnuplot&gt;  set palette functions (2*cos(gray*pi+pi/3)**4+cos(gray*pi+pi*0.66)**2)/3, 0.5*cos(gray*pi+pi*0.55)**8, (cos(gray*pi-pi/6)**4*2+cos(gray*pi+pi*0.66)**8)/3;<br/>
      gnuplot&gt;  set cbrange [-pi:pi]<br/>
      gnuplot&gt;  plot [-100:100][-100:100] "&lt; paste lowd-proj highd-dataset" u 1:2:15 w p pt 7 ps 0.1 lt pal<br/>

   <p>
      Note that in cases such as this where the high-dimensional points have periodic nature it is important
      to define a palette which is periodic as well. Also, note how the different data set can be combined 
      from within gnuplot by using the <span class="code">"&lt; command"</span> construct.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      When one is representing just the embedding of the landmark points, 
      and these have a variable weight factor, it is useful to represent such 
      weight to avoid being distracted by the location of landmarks of negligible
      weight. To do so, one can use <span class="code">ps variable</span>, and read
      in the weights by a <span class="code">using x:y:size:color</span> clause. 
   </p>
   <div class="code">
      gnuplot&gt;  p [-100:100][-100:100] "&lt;paste lowd-gmds-smap_0 highd-landmarks" u 1:2:(sqrt($27)*0.2):16 w p pt 7 lt pal ps var
